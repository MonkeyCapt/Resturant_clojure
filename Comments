I feel that the hardest thing for something like this to be fully implementated because of language barrier and the location of of the data base is presented. 
Another reason Ifeel that this is needed is because you have to understand where your database is coming from and also the type of food that your individual would like. 
Efficency is another key element in programming something like this because the consumer is likely impatient.
