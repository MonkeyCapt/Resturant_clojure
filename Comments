I feel that the hardest thing for something like this to be fully implementated because of language barrier and the location of of the data base is presented. 
Another reason Ifeel that this is needed is because you have to understand where your database is coming from and also the type of food that your individual would like. 
Efficency is another key element in programming something like this because the consumer is likely impatient. 
Another problem that would be challenging in this type of implemetaion would the problem to get it to appear in a search list when actually listed.
Ensuring that the code is valid and correspondes with any of the existing code that a database would already have.
The code to be featured as something that would be needed to make sure that all of the correct parameters are always included and always abided by.
